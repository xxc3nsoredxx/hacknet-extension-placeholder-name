This is the bio for Feklms

He is a biological creature. I think. No one has actually seen the elusive
Feklms.

Legend has is that, if you're lucky, Feklms will scurry across your floor at
night. Some have even attributed the recent disappearances of children between
the ages of 3 and 13 to Feklms. Not everyone thinks Feklms is a bad creature.
Some just think he is misunderstood. Some suggest that children go with him
willingly.
